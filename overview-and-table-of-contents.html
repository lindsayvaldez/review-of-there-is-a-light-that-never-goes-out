These films are known for their humorous realism, rebellion, and poverty within a young individual's life. He provides an in depth look into Morrissey's choice of lyrics and band aesthetics, and how they were influenced by the working class realism during the time. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author argues that The Smith’s aesthetic and lyrical themes align closely with the working-class and are used as an advocate for these people. The author utilizes films from the 1950s and 1960s such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taste of Honey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday Night And Sunday Morning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to strengthen her claims. These films discuss social critique and encapsulate emotional rawness, found within the Smiths </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">album as well. He uses this to argue how The Smiths were more than a pop band, but rather developed a realist style, avoiding fantasy and focusing on everyday struggles with humor and drama. The author draws upon films from the British new wave, as well as many lyrics from Morrissey himself. She indicates that Morrsisey even references the film </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taste of Honey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his song </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Night Has Opened My Eyes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the lyrics closely align with the story of the film about an unwanted pregnancy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author supports her claim by drawing parallels between The Smiths lyrics and themes within the kitchen sink films, utilizing a comparative analysis. In The Smiths, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she argues that Morrsisey is singing about work and alienation, such as in the lyric, “I was looking for a job and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now.” This suggests that even after achieving a basic normality, the narrator is still unsatisfied, which is a common theme within kitchen sink films. She also does this by examining The Smiths aesthetic and comparing it to a kitchen sink film. She claims their black and white vintage album covers and clothing, which was typically second-hand shirts or cardigans, indicate they played a role as plain, simple, and ultimately as the working class persona. His lyrics discuss loneliness and common struggles between family, relationships, and jobs, which are common themes found within a kitchen sink film. Many of The Smiths' songs exaggerate misery to the point of absurdity, making their songs almost carefree or humorous, which is the intention of these films. Through these comparisons, the author effectively demonstrates how The Smiths embody similar characteristics of kitchen sink realism, using their music to reflect the struggles and humor of working-class life. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mello presents her argument effectively and offers valuable insights into The Smiths, providing a well-structured exploration of the band's lyrics and aesthetics. Although The Smiths write heavily on realism, she fails to argue that there are many differences between their music and kitchen sink films. The author focuses too heavily on realism, as if that is their main and only theme, though their songs are very romance based. The Smiths also present their claim as more poetically rather than politically, although it is a political topic, The Smiths write more personable. Mello could strengthen her writing by addressing counterarguments and acknowledging areas where information is uncertain. Recognizing different perspectives on the band's history would add nuance to her work and create a more balanced analysis. While she does a commendable job of presenting detailed information, incorporating her own critical voice would enhance the depth of his examination.</span></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
