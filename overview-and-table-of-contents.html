The band's aesthetic and lyrical themes closely reflect working-class experiences and serve as a form of advocacy for that community. The author draws connections from British films, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taste of Honey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noting their shared themes of social critique and emotional rawness—particularly evident in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> album. She argues that The Smiths were more than just a pop band; they aspired to realism, rejecting fantasy in favor of everyday struggles portrayed with both humor and drama. Morrissey, the band’s lyricist, often quoted directly from these films, “borrowing the voice of these characters, bringing them back to life in his lyrics” (Mello 2016, 141). For example, “This Night Has Opened My Eyes” closely mirrors the plot of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Taste of Honey</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which centers on an unwanted pregnancy (Mello 2016, 143). Morrissey drew from stories from the films, as well as used common themes of kitchen-sink cinema. In “Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now,” the lyric “I was looking for a job and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now” reflects themes of alienation and disillusionment, common in kitchen-sink dramas. Morrissey’s lyrics were commonly inspired from these films’ themes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen-sink films were a British film movement, showcasing the working class realities of life post-war Britain. Clarke refers to World War II as a "people's war," highlighting how it united citizens across class lines in a shared desire for victory. (Clarke 1996, 207).This post-war sense of collective identity and attention to everyday struggles continued to resonate in British culture, influencing not only film but music as well. (Chapman 1991). Mello examines The Smiths’ aesthetic and compares it to kitchen-sink films. She claims that their black-and-white vintage album covers and clothing—typically second-hand shirts or cardigans—indicate that they portrayed themselves as plain, simple, and ultimately as embodying a working-class persona. Kitchen sink films, like <em data-start="92" data-end="127">Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</em>, center white working-class lives while omitting the racial diversity present in post-war Britain. Similarly, Warnes argues that The Smiths’ album covers exclude racial representation and overlook the band's indebtedness to Black Atlantic musical influences. (Warnes 2008, 140-147). This theme of kitchen-sink cinema even inspired the origin of the band name, The Smiths, as Morrissey says was, “the most ordinary name and I thought it was time the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces.” (Mello 2016, 152). Many of The Smiths' songs exaggerate misery to the point of absurdity, making their songs almost carefree or humorous</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is the intention of these films. (Mello 2016, 141). Thro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ugh these comparisons, the author effectively demonstrates how The Smiths embody similar characteristics of kitchen sink realism, using their music to reflect the struggles and humor of working-class life. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mello presents her argument effectively and offers valuable insights into The Smiths, providing a well-structured exploration of the band's lyrics and aesthetics. She reinforces her argument by citing works such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Critical History of the British Cinema</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Roy Armes, which supports her claim that many British film directors were middle-class individuals portraying working-class life without critically examining their own privilege. She explains how this view is what dominates much of the kitchen-sink cycle. (Mello 2016, 138). Mello at times places too much emphasis on realism, overlooking the strong undercurrent of romantic themes that also define much of The Smiths’ music. The Smiths also express their political standpoint more poetically than overtly political; their writing is more personal and intimate. Mello could strengthen her writing by addressing counterarguments and acknowledging areas where information is uncertain. Recognizing different perspectives on the band's history would add nuance to her work and create a more balanced analysis. Through Mello’s analysis, it is prominent that The Smiths used the aesthetics and themes of kitchen-sink cinema to challenge pop music conventions and give voice to working-class alienation, thereby blurring the lines between popular culture and social critique.</span></p><p><br style="font-weight: 400;"><br></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
