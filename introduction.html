The song is arguably the ultimate anthem of longing and escapism, and is often referred to as the best song The Smiths ever released. The song embodies the band's defining characteristics and features profoundly impactful lyrics. A performance that perfectly encapsulates these defining traits is their live recording at Kilburn National Ballroom in London, played during </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tour on October 23, 1986. This concert was later used for their </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> album, their only live album, which was released in 1988 after the band’s breakup. The song was produced by Rough Trade in the United Kingdom and Sire Records in the United States. “There’s A Light That Never Goes Out” embodies the band’s signature blend of melancholy and romance, which is especially evident in their live performance at Kilburn National Ballroom in 1986. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The live performance of “There’s A Light That Never Goes Out” was particularly significant as it took place during their peak era, corresponding with the release of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, widely regarded as their greatest album. The live recording is essential because it captures the band's raw energy and the emotional intensity of their performance. Unlike their polished studio albums, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preserves the dramatic, electrifying atmosphere of The Smiths' live shows, showcasing Morrissey’s raw and emotive vocal delivery alongside Johnny Marr’s dynamic and intricate guitar work. In this live setting, Morrissey sings with even greater urgency and emotion, making the song feel deeply personal and immediate. The song’s impulsive and desperate energy is amplified in the performance, reinforcing its themes of longing and escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most memorable moments of the performance occurs when Morrissey theatrically throws his microphone stand before delivering the iconic lyric, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a double-decker bus crashes into us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This line holds a dramatic and moving meaning, expressing the idea that dying with a loved one would be a beautiful fate. Throughout the performance, Morrissey interacts intensely with the audience, as he extends his arms toward the audience as he drags his body loosely and clutches his shirt. At one point, he sits on a speaker, eyes closed, embodying the song’s melancholy atmosphere. Despite the song’s somber lyrics, he dances in an upbeat manner, moving his hips in circular motions with his hands on his hips and waving them in the air, showcasing the duality of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a Light That Never Goes Out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a song that is both melancholic and strangely uplifting. He also elongates and emphasizes certain words such as, “Oh, Lover”, making the song even more dramatic and emotionally charged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular recording is not just significant because of the performance itself but also because of its release following The Smiths’ breakup. The band officially split in 1987, shortly before the release of their final studio album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangeways, Here We Come</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The breakup stemmed from tensions between Morrissey and Johnny Marr, who had developed creative differences. Marr, feeling constrained and exhausted by The Smiths' relentless workload, expressed a desire to collaborate with other musicians. Morrissey, in response, proposed recording covers of '60s artists, which Marr opposed. Eventually, Marr decided to leave for good. The split was bitter, and legal disputes followed. Bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce later claimed they felt undervalued in the band (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrest, 2023</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Fortunately for fans, The Smiths left behind one final live album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released a year after their breakup, serving as a farewell and offering a glimpse of their onstage brilliance. This album cemented their legendary status, proving that their live performances carried as much, if not more, electricity and emotion as their studio recordings. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smiths had a rare ability to merge romantic and uplifting emotions with melancholy and youthful longing. Morrissey’s lyric, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die,” conveys a dramatic yet deeply relatable desire to escape reality with a loved one. The contrast between the song’s sorrowful undertone and its romantic sentiment gives it a timeless emotional weight that resonates across generations. Although it was never officially released as a single, “There’s a Light That Never Goes Out” became one of The Smiths' most iconic and celebrated tracks. Over the years, it has been covered by major artists such as Noel Gallagher, Miley Cyrus, and Death Cab for Cutie, showcasing its popular appeal. The song has also been referenced in films and TV shows, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 Days of Summer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reinforcing its status as a cultural standard. (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NME, 2011</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Ultimately, “There’s a Light That Never Goes Out” embodies all that made The Smiths exceptional: detailed storytelling, lyrical cleverness, and profound emotional resonance.</span></p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
