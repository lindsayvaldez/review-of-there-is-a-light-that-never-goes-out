The song’s live performance at Kilburn National Ballroom in 1986, later featured on their </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Album, captures this raw emotional intensity of Morrisey’s dramatic stage presence and Johnny Marr’s intricate guitar moments. I argue that this performance, occurring at the peak of their career during </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">era, highlights the song’s themes of escapism and devotion, making it both haunting and uplifting. Similarly to how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen Is Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gained chart recognition, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. This performance in particular demonstrates The Smith’s ability to connect with a live audience and showcase their drama, which reinforces the song’s theme. (Davies, 2006). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the section </span><strong><a href="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/backgroundhistorical-context.html">“The Stages of Love: A Playlist of Melancholy and Romance,”</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I explore the central themes in “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out” of emotional complexity and stages of love. Each song in the playlist relates to “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out” in particular ways, yet all share similar melancholy melodies and profound lyrics. This section examines various songs in the playlist which capture different stages of love, from infatuation and desire to heartbreak and lingering emotions. “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out” was a pivotal song that not only expanded The Smith’s appeal, but also showcased a more romantic and emotional side of the band. (Dukes, et al., 2003). </span></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
