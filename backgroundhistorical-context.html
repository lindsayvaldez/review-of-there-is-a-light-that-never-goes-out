This playlist embraces that same emotional complexity, weaving through different stages of love, from the intoxicating highs to the aching lows. Each song here explores the journey of love in its various forms, echoing the essence of “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out.” Tracks like “Pictures of You”, “Apocalypse”, “Just Like Heaven”, “Linger”, and “Do I Wanna Know?” all share a romantic thread, but each also carries its own bittersweet undertones, capturing moments of longing, doubt, and reflection. “Lover, You Should’ve Come Over" adds a layer of emotional depth with its dramatic intensity and raw yearning, similar to the desperate longing found in The Smiths’ music. “Silver Springs” mirrors this intensity, with its haunting live performances evoking the same sense of loss and longing that defines “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” enduring emotional power. The structure of the playlist follows the natural progression of a relationship—from the spark of attraction and deep connection to the inevitable sense of longing and the realization of loss. It’s an emotional arc that flows seamlessly, taking listeners through moments of passion, heartache, and ultimately, a quiet acceptance of love’s impermanence. This playlist is not just about love, it’s about how love lingers, how it transforms, and the emotions that remain long after the lights have gone out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cure’s</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pictures of You” contemplates the emotional impact photographs can have, capturing a sense of longing and sorrow. The use of long drawn out words to dramatize the lyrics is present as well in The Smiths “There's A Light That Never Goes Out.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This song delves into themes of regret and reflection as the narrator revisits various feelings inspired by a photograph. This song can be interpreted many ways, as one being the early stages of love or admiration, where one is captivated by another and deeply entwined in affection, but have regrets as they have missed the moment. The narrator yearns for the person in the photo, painting a romantic yet profoundly melancholic picture. Before a relationship, one must yearn for the other, which is what this song signifies. It is sung in past tense, as he feels as though the narrator has already missed their opportunity. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this point, one can either take a chance and see if their lover reciprocates their feelings or remain passive and watch the opportunity fade away. This phase is intimidating, filled with fear and longing. “Lover, You Should’ve Come Over” by Jeff Buckley expresses regret and yearning in love, articulating a sense of missed opportunities within a relationship and pondering what could have been. The repeated word "should've" highlights actions that should have occurred but didn’t, leading to deep regret. The narrator displays self-awareness, recognizing that it is now too late due to his own imperfections.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once someone has found their beloved and is captivated, they enter a waiting phase, uncertain if their feelings are returned. This stage is characterized by fear and hesitation. “Do I Wanna Know?” by Hozier depicts a scenario where the narrator hesitates to discover if his lover feels the same way. The song explores themes of desire, vulnerability, and deep romance, with lyrics that delve into the realm of unspoken emotions, where the narrator grapples with confronting the truth or remaining in uncertainty. An obsessive quality emerges during this phase, where one is fixated on their feelings and the uncomfortable urge to know.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After mutual affection is established, feelings of joy and excitement arise. “Just Like Heaven</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Cure encapsulates these delightful emotions associated with being in love, representing the initial stage of love, characterized by bliss before chaos sets in. The song celebrates the thrill and intensity of falling in love, almost dreamlike in its quality. Unlike the others, this track is more catchy and upbeat, while still retaining a hint of melancholy. It’s an overjoyed tribute to exhilarating love and being completely immersed in the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These feelings of joy and butterflies can quickly turn overwhelming, possessive, and obsessive. In “There's A Light That Never Goes Out”, The Smiths popular line, “And if a double decker bus crashes into us. To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die,” expresses the narrator's intense emotions in love. He encapsulates how one jumps to extremes once in love, as if what they are doing is not enough and must dramatically develop intense scenarios. The melody is melancholy and slow with intense and concerning lyrics which may go unnoticed without attentive listening. </span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apocalypse</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Cigarettes After Sex navigates similar themes of romantic longing and existential reflection. The lyrics convey a sense of yearning and vulnerability, mirroring a stage where the narrator has fallen deeply in love, accompanied by fear. As the narrator invests more emotionally, the initial joy diminishes, replaced by apprehension about whether their feelings are mutual. The slow tempo and ethereal instrumentals create a haunting atmosphere, embodying intimacy and contemplation. This stage of a relationship encapsulates the feeling of when one is in so deep, they are almost fearful of this obsession. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Silver Springs (Live)” by Fleetwood Mac was written by band member Stevie Nicks as an emotional response to her bandmate Lindsey Buckingham. In the live version, Stevie performs with intense emotion and passion. Stevie is in the stage of anger and torment of recurring memories in her mind. The lyrics express lingering and unresolved feelings. This stage in a relationship reflects one that has not unfolded as anticipated, leaving emotions unaddressed. Stevie powerfully sings the line, “You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you,” serving as a haunting reminder of her presence in Nick's life. The live version of this song encapsulates the drama and anger through the lyrics, just as “There’s A Light That Never Goes Out” is sung dramatically and filled with passion. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after resolving a relationship or moving on from a breakup, traces of that connection can linger. “Linger” by The Cranberries encapsulates the remnants of a past relationship and the hurt and betrayal that accompany it. Lingering emotions in a relationship can be incredibly complex, as one grapples with recurring feelings stemming from emotional ties. After relationships end, unresolved issues often hinder the ability to let go. The Cranberries poignantly express this struggle in the line, “You got me wrapped around your finger Do you have to let it linger?” Just as “There's A Light That Never Goes Out", the lyrics are extremely direct and immediate from the narrator's thoughts. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Love is far from simple and is filled with lingering emotions, transformations, and imprints that remain even once the relationship has faded. This playlist mirrors the emotional complexity of “There's A Light That Never Goes Out”, following the journey from infatuation to longing, obsession, and heartbreak. Each song encapsulates a different stage of this experience carrying a mix of melancholy and romance that resonates deeply. Much like The Smiths haunting tune “There's A Light That Never Goes Out", these songs capture the different stages of love and its profound impact – where even after love fades, the emotions linger long after it’s over. </span></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https:// lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
