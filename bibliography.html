While it does not mention The Smiths or their song, "There's A Light That Never Goes Out," it discusses the political climate that influenced the band’s music. The author, Richard Chapman, a professor of politics at the University of Durham, is a respected scholar who specializes in civil service and public policy. He explains that public services aim for efficiency and accountability, that applying private sector methods in government presents certain challenges, and that economic objectives are considered alongside the public interest. Chapman organizes his analysis around key thematic sections that begin with an introduction, giving context of the public sector reforms and key issues, and end with a conclusion, giving long-term implications of these reforms for governance. The sections involve the motivations, strategies, and outcomes of these reforms, highlighting the shift towards market oriented approaches. From this, his article is strengthened because he presents a logical analysis while connecting his theories to real political developments. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarke, Peter. 1996. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilty men 1937-45.” In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope and Glory: Britain 1900-1990, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">edited by David Cannadine, 207-208. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penguin Books. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Clarke draws on the political situation between 1937 to 1945 in his chapter "Guilty men 1937-45." On pages 207 and 208, he explains that during the 1940s, World War II was often called the "people's war" because it highlighted the working class, as both they and the upper classes were united in fighting for a shared cause. This idea connects to The Smiths, whose album themes often focus on working-class life and express support for their struggles. He argues that while the war did disrupt traditional boundaries of race, gender, and class, the extent to which this unity existed depends on how one defines the term, says Clarke. He suggests that the notion of a shared national experience, especially moments like the summer of 1940, was powerful and emotionally resonant, even if it did not erase existing inequalities. To show the viewpoint of the upper classes, he refers to Harold Nicolson’s diary, which reveals that people from all social backgrounds shared a common desire for victory. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davies, Chris. 2006. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smiths: Under Review</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Prism Films.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This 90-minute documentary offers a critical, journalistic analysis of The Smiths, blending historical and contemporary perspectives on the band’s evolution. The film, produced by pop culture and rock music critics, provides a media-driven overview rather than an academic approach. It includes authentic footage, live performances, and interviews with producers, journalists, individuals with personal ties to the band, and even fans, such as Grant Showbiz (a Smiths crew member), Kenny Jones (producer), and Paul Morley (journalist). Critics analyze the band’s lyrics, focusing on Morrissey’s themes of alienation, romanticism, and identity, particularly in songs like “Charming Man” and “Hand in Glove.” They argue that “Charming Man,” with its complex lyrical content and introspective themes, helped solidify The Smiths’ signature sound and ignited speculation about Morrissey’s sexuality. The documentary also delves into the band’s instrumental choices, noting Johnny Marr’s jangly guitar style as key to their distinctive sound. The film touches on the political climate of the 1980s and how the band’s music reflected and responded to it. It is an engaging and accessible resource for understanding the complete story of The Smiths, including the themes and creative process behind tracks like “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dukes, Richard, Tara Bisel, Borega, Karoline, Eligio Lobato, and Matthew Owens. 2003. “Expressions of love, sex, and hurt in popular songs: A content analysis of all-time greatest hits.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Science Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 40 (4): 643–650. https://doi.org/10.1016/s0362-3319(03)00075-2. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This journal discusses themes of love, sex, and emotional pain in popular songs throughout the eras. They examine the prevalence of these themes in top-charting songs and differences in lyrical themes across musical generations. All of the authors are affiliated with the Department of Sociology at the University of Colorado. Richard L. Dykes, who earned his Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Southern California, is a Professor of Sociology. His scholarly work spans various areas within sociology, but is particularly recognized for his research in youth and adolescence. The article consists of an Introduction, Hypothesis, Methods, Results, and Index. It  analyzes the 100 most popular songs from 1958 to 1998 and examines how artist demographics and expressions of love, sex, and selfishness in lyrics have changed over time. They conduct this by coding for specific themes and the presence of specific psychological and genre characteristics, using word counts to systematically assess how expressions of love vary across time. The study reveals that although women and Black artists achieved more chart-topping songs in the 1990s, mentions of love in lyrics by female artists declined, sexual references reached their highest points at different periods for men and women, and the general portrayal of love in song lyrics stayed consistent over time.​​ The majority of the references the article uses are a mix of primary sources, the song and artist, psychological works on love, and key reference materials such as Billboard chart data and music industry analyses. This article provides a sociological perspective of how themes of love, sex, and emotional pain are expressed in popular music, offering valuable context for analyzing these same recurring motifs in The Smiths’ songs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrest, Ben. 2023. “Understanding the Break-up of the Smiths.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far Out Magazine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, December 30. faroutmagazine.co.uk/exploring-break-up-of-the-smiths/.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hubbs, Nadine. 1996. “Music of the ‘Fourth Gender’: Morrissey and the Sexual Politics of Melodic Contour. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genders. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">23: 266-297. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article examines how Morrissey uses musical elements and the movement of a melody to express or complicate gender and sexual identity. It relates to my essay about The Smiths and their non-use of gender, as it offers both theoretical and a musical framework for thinking about how Morrissey plays with gender identity. The author is a musicologist and professor at the University of Michigan whose work explores the intersections of music, gender and sexuality. Hubbs argues that Morrissey’s deliberate ambiguity, refusing fixed labels of sexuality or gender, creates a space for queer interpretation. Hubbs shows how Morrissey uses melody and unclear lyrics to express nonbinary desire, especially in songs that avoid clear endings and reflect what Lee Edelman calls “queer negativity.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mello, Cecília. 2016. “I don’t owe you anything’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smiths and kitchen-sink cinema.” In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Pamper Life’s Complexities?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Manchester University Press.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://doi.org/10.7765/9780719095023.00012">https://doi.org/10.7765/9780719095023.00012</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chapter of Cecilia’s novel delves into the societal pressure resolving self care, wealth, and personal responsibility within a contemporary life. It revolves around themes of personal struggle, social critique, and alienation - all of which The Smith's album </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Queen is Dead</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> truly revolves around. The author discusses how The Smith’s music and lyrics address the disenchantment with societal norms and the complexities of individuals. The publication, Manchester University Press, is an established academic publisher known for producing scholarly books and journals. The author, Cecilia Mello has a background in cultural studies, often focusing on social issues and identity within everyday life. This novel argues that there are superficial aspects of modern culture, which commonly pamper over the struggles of individuals navigating complex life circumstances. Self-care is exploited as a universal solution, yet disregards the symbolization of wealth and class which fall into that category; creating an ultimate economic inequality. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NME. 2011.“NME.COM Users Vote 'There Is a Light That Never Goes Out’ as the greatest Smiths song.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">NME</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 21 November. www.nme.com/news/music/the-smiths-51-1273954. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pattie, David. 2007. “The 1980s.” In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock Music in Performance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palgrave Macmillan London. 104-126.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock Music in Performance</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> David Pattie–Reader in Drama and Theatre Studies at the University of Chester–examines how artists during that decade navigate the evolving relationship between authenticity and image, particularly in the context of new technologies like music videos and synthesizers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His more prominent work includes a book on Samuel Beckett, published in 2001, and he has written numerous pieces exploring modern performance, pop culture, and music. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">His analysis relates indirectly to The Smiths, as he highlights how emotional lyrics and stage presence of rock music creates a powerful connection between the performer and the audience, particularly in the era when this song was released. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book is divided into two parts: Part I explores performance and authenticity, while Part II focuses on how historical and cultural shifts shape those concepts. In the chapter on the 1980s, Pattie argues that although New Wave initially emphasized raw, self-expressive performance, the rise of MTV, new technologies, and corporate sponsorships pushed rock toward more visually driven commercialized presentations. Pattie explains that the 1980s marked a shift in performance, where gender and sexuality became increasingly theatrical and ambiguous – driven in part by the rise of MTV and visual culture. He points to artists like David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Prince, who embraced androgynous appearances and performances, similar to how The Smiths created their own unconventional image during the decade. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rukes, Frederic. 2017. "The Disruption of Normativity: Queer Desire and Negativity in Morrissey and The Smiths." Gender Forum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">64: 4-22.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article explores how The Smiths lead singer, Morrissey, and his band approach challenges of queer desire and negativity and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how Morrissey creates sexual and gender fluidity within his lyrics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The author, Fredrick Rukes of the University of Cologne, draws on queer theory Eve Kosofosky Sedgwick’s work on same-gender bonds, Teresa De Lauretis’s work of non-normative narratives, and Harold Beaver’s examination of homosexual signs. Drawing on ideas from these thinkers helps further his claim that Morrissey uses feelings like sadness and longing in creative ways. Instead of seeing these emotions as weaknesses, he turns them into a way to question what society sees as normal – breaking norms. He supports Teresa de Lauretis’s ideas but adds that there is a straight viewpoint in Morrissey’s lyrics that can still be seen as queer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He examines the strategies Morrissey uses to challenge society's fixed ideas about sexuality and identity by keeping his lyrics open-ended, filling his work with symbols that hint queer identity, and avoiding direct references. He argues that the band does not disclose traditional narratives and critique societal norms and are often described as ambiguous. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By analyzing Morrissey’s disruption of normative identities, I will deepen my analysis by exploring The Smiths’ cultural significance beyond their status, highlighting their broader social and cultural impact.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warnes, Andrew. 2008. “Black, White and Blue: The Racial Antagonism of The Smiths’ Record Sleeves.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Music </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">27 (1) : 135–149. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261143008001463">https://doi.org/10.1017/S0261143008001463</a>.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central focus of this journal article is about how The Smiths’ record acts as a “smokescreen” covering the band’s true influence of Black Atlantic music. Warnes is a scholar of American literature and Professor in the School of English at the University of Leeds. His work focuses on cultural studies and particularly race within popular culture. Popular Music is a peer-reviewed academic journal that focuses on the analysis of contemporary popular music, examining its cultural, social, and political contexts. Warnes discusses how their album covers speculations of Morrissey’s sexuality, but also how Morrissey excludes racial presentation in the band’s aesthetic. Warnes writes this piece as a critique of The Smiths’ and suggests that they purposefully reinforced their “whiteness” to deny their albums connections to Black traditional music. Throughout the article, the author speaks very formally and academically with in-text citations and various forms of media, including a script from songwriter Morrsisey himself. Warnes effectively presents his argument with supporting resources, but much of his analysis is ultimately based on opinion. This piece explores themes of race in The Smiths' work, making it important to acknowledge the challenges in addressing their racial influences when researching their work.</span></p><p><br style="font-weight: 400;"><br></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://lindsayvaldez.github.io/review-of-there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
